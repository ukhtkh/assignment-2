<h1 class="heading">Malcolm x & Salafiyyah</h1>

<h2 class="heading-2">Malcolm x's Salafi sheikh</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Shaykh Aḥmad Ḥassūn (1897-1971 CE) is widely regarded as the founding leader of Ansār al-Sunnah al-Muḥammadiyá  in Sudan – the original Ansār al-Sunnah al-Muḥammadiyá praised by major scholars such as Muḥammad Ḥāmid al-Fiqḥī, Ibn Bāz, al-Albānī, and Muḥammad al-Banná, and not the political party known today. He was a unique figure in Sudanese society, having graduated from the Postal and Telegraph School, he was considered an Effendi but never forgot his place in the world. He focused on religion and Islamic sciences, spreading the Sunnah while opposing innovations and the Sūfī paths. He suffered greatly from all sides because of his opposition to political parties, movements, and innovations. Shaykh Aḥmad Ḥassūn was among the first to raise the banner of Tawḥīd and Sunnah in Sudan, and struggled greatly during a critical period when sectarianism was on the rise. </p>

<h2 class="heading-2">The sheikh's influence on Malcolm x</h2>
<p class="paragraph">When Malcolm X visited the Holy Lands, he stayed with Shaykh Aḥmad Ḥassūn in Mekkah. King Faisal appointed Shaykh Aḥmad as a guide for Malcolm and a teacher at the newly established Islamic Mosque No. 7 in Harlem, New York. Malcolm X spoke at that mosque and oversaw the African-American Union, which he established after returning from Hajj. Along with his work at the mosque. Shaykh Ḥassūn served as a religious mentor to him, guiding him through the grand concepts of Islam and the meanings of Islamic texts.  Shaykh Aḥmad also guided him through Islamic fundamentals when he educated the African-American community. During Malcolm’s public lectures and religious seminars, the Shaykh could be seen by his side.  Shaykh Aḥmad Ḥassūn continued to accompany him, advise him, enlighten him, explain Qur’anic verses and rulings until Malcolm’s assassination.

<h2 class="heading-2">Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Differences with Elijah Muhammad prompted Malcolm to leave the Nation of Islam in 1964. A pilgrimage to Mecca led him to acknowledge the possibility of world brotherhood and to convert to orthodox Islam. Members of the Nation made threats against his life, and he was shot to death at a rally in a Harlem ballroom. His celebrated autobiography (1965) was written by Alex Haley on the basis of numerous interviews conducted shortly before Malcolm’s death.</p>
